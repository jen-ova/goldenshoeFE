Golden Shoe is a fictional e-commerce application. I made this as part of a job interview, where i had to deliver a responsive web application that solved the problems of Golden Shoe as a company.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project's authentication runs via the backend and redux. Clone and start that repo first.

Make sure you are in the root directory where package.json is located.

npm install

npm start

It should run on your localhost.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
